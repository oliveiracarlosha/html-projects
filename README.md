# html-projects: study repository.

This repository is intended to HTML and CSS study, sometimes a bit of JS.

Based on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-projects-for-beginners-to-practice-html-and-css-skills/ which has a bunch of little projects for begginers.

Pretend to update this constantly until I feel more confortable with HTML and CSS development.

Feel free to fork and use as a inspirational device for your development.
